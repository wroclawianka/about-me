## Welcome!

Hi! I am Dorota and I am a Frontend Developer. I created a couple of projects with the use of JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, React and related technologies which you can check below. 

## About me

I am a huge agile enthusiast and I enjoy working in a dynamic team. I am a well-organized person with plenty of motivation, which does not afraid of challenges at work. I consider myself a good self-learner and I put an effort to grow my professional skills.

I am working in IT since 2014. Before frontend development, I have gained 4 years of experience in quality assurance. I am experienced in test automation with Selenium and JavaScript, Java and C#. I was also working with such tools such as Ansible and Jenkins. I this time I had a chance to be a part of multiple international teams, including:
- Fortify Static Code Analyzer, which identifies vulnerabilities in the software projects
- Collibra DGC platform, that provides tools for data management and stewardship
- and in PGS Software, where I was working on an internal company system.
